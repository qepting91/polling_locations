## Aggregated Data
- The Aggregated_github_data.csv file contains historical polling locations pulled from the following project, https://github.com/PublicI/us-polling-places , predominately 2020, however some states had 2018 data. The following states were not included in that data, and therefore this repository aims to explore how to collect this data for the following areas:
    - America Samoa
    - Arizona
    - Colorado
    - District of Columbia
    - Florida
    - Guam
    - Hawaii
    - Idaho
    - Kansas
    - New York
    - Oregon
    - Puerto Rico
    - Tennessee
    - Virgin Island
    - Washington
    - Wyoming

## Data Collection
- The data collection process is to first identify where polling locations are most likely to be, each state or territory may have a separate preference for where polling locations are. 

- The next step will be to look for open source datasets that will allow for addresses to be pulled in a manner that will allow for statewide coverage of polling locations.
